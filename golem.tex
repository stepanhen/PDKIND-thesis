\chapter{Golem}

What Golem is. 
How it works. 
What inputs it recieves.
How is the framework structured (language etc.). Analyze how we integrate our engine into it (library, different language or the same way as other engines are integrated.

Golem is a satisfiability solver for constrained horn clauses over linear, real, and integer arithmetic. It consists of multiple model-checking algorithms, which solve the satisfiability problem. Currently, there are five of them: BMC, KIND, IMC, LAWI, and SPACER. In this thesis, we will be adding an implementation of the PD-KIND algorithm into the solver.
