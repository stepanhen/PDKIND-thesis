\chapter{Conclusion}
During this work, we introduced ourselves with the concept of the CHC framework. Then, we defined the concepts of transition systems and satisfiability modulo theories. After that, we described the structure of Golem and analyzed the best way to integrate a new engine into it. We then analyzed the entire PDKind algorithm and modified it to serve our needs.

With this knowledge, we implemented the PDKind engine itself. The goal was to create an engine that would 1) be well integrated into the Golem framework, 2) return correct answers, and 3) match the performance of other engines. To validate these goals, we experimentally compared our engine with other existing Golem engines. We managed to achieve results comparable to other engines, and in some cases, our engine was faster, although it did not reach the performance of the best-performing engine.

We believe that this engine presents a well-performing alternative to other engines, with its usefulness expected to grow with further improvements.
